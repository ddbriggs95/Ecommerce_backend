# Ecommerce_backend

## Description

This project is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays creation of database using mySQL with models and associations. Then demonstrates the API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through video.
## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
- WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username and password to an enviornment variable file
- THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
- THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and Seqeuelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT. and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
- Then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
